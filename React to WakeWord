wakeWord

This sample shows how to code Misty to respond when she hears the "Hey,
Misty!" key phrase.

When you call the misty.StartKeyPhraseRecognition() command, Misty
listens for the key phrase by continuously sampling audio from the
environment and comparing that audio to her trained key phrase model
(in this case, "Hey, Misty!"). Misty does not create or save audio
recordings while listening for the key phrase.

You must start key phrase recognition before Misty can send
KeyPhraseRecognized event messages. We follow these steps to code Misty
to respond to the "Hey, Misty!" key phrase:

1. Issue a misty.StartKeyPhraseRecognition() command.
2. Register for KeyPhraseRecognized events. When Misty hears the key
phrase, she sends a message to KeyPhraseRecognized event listeners.
Note that Misty stops listening for the key phrase each time she hears
the wake word, and you'd need to issue another command to start key
phrase recognition to start her listening again.
3. Write the code to handle what Misty should do when she hears the key
phrase inside the event callback. For example, you might have Misty
turn to face you or start recording audio to hand off to a
third-party service for additional processing.

We've left a lot of comments in this code for developers new to the
Misty platform. If you already know your way around, feel free to
ignore them!

method by passing in a different name as an optional argument when you
call the misty.RegisterEvent() method.
